# World_Health_Index_Analysis
Analysis of World Health Index Data using R. Most of the Analysis and the context is provided in the Rmd file.<br>
The datasets are provided in excel format. I have cleaned the dataset and save as `.rda` file for analysis purposes.<br>
The Rmd file is also knit to view the output in `.html` format.<br>
The original datasets are provided in the Data folder. You might have to change the directory after downloading.
*Note:* There is a hyper parameter tuning function for optimizing the values of `xgboost` model parameters. Any user might choose to skip that part of the code. This takes very long time to run (up to 12 hours depending on system configuration). The output is too big in size and cannot be uploaded in GitHub (owing to 25 MB file size limit).
